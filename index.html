                <h2>What Are Beauty Standards?
                </h2>

How someone must have a perfcect body, flawless skin and beautiful blue eyes with blonde hair. If girls don't have these trending ideas then they aren't beautiful to today's stadards. An example is hairy arms: If a girl has hairy arms, then girls aren't pretty because this idea of being pretty doesn't include hairy amrs therefore "they aren't worthy of being beautiful".
